See "Composing Tracks"

***** ***** COMPOSING TRACKS ***** *****

Here is a short guide on composing your own MIDI tracks.

Each song has four midi tracks, one for each difficulty. The only rules around difficulty are:
- Only expert and expert+ have bar/thumb notes
- Easy, medium, and expert tracks can have no more than TWO keys held or pressed at the same time. Expert+ mode can have as many simultaneous keys as you want

Both tracks can use the same MIDI file if there is no difference between the two difficulties.

The note map from MIDI to the game is as follows:

G#2 (56) - right pinky hold
G2  (55) - right pinky
F#2 (54) - right ring hold
F2  (53) - right ring
D#2 (51) - right middle hold
D2  (50) - right middle
C#2 (49) - right index hold
C2  (48) - right index
B1  (47) - right thumb
Bb1 (46) - right thumb hold

G#2 (44) - left index hold
G2  (43) - left index
F#2 (42) - left middle hold
F2  (41) - left middle
D#2 (39) - left ring hold
D2  (38) - left ring
C#2 (37) - left pinky hold
C2  (36) - left pinky
B1  (35) - left thumb
Bb1 (34) - left thumb hold

Note that each note has a hold and non-hold variant. The hold notes will last as long as the MIDI note. Try to leave a small space between the end of one hold note and the start on the next one.

The game should be able to handle any tempo and time signatue changes in the MIDI file.

The game is currently not able to handle MIDI files with any notes outside of the mapped notes. The game will freeze up if you try to play a MIDI file with a note out of place.
