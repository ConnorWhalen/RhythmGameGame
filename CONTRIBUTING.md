Post any questions, problems, bugs, or requests in Issues. I am not picky on format or relevance starting out. So post away! This is subject to change if the rate of issues increases.

Feel free to submit pull requests with changes, fixes, and features. I reserve the right to deny a pull request for any reason ofc.
